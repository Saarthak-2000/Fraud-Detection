Model Performance and Selection Rationale
Both Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT) achieve comparable accuracy, but RF outperforms in precision—a critical metric for fraud detection. In such models, minimizing false positives (legit transactions flagged as fraud) and false negatives (fraud transactions missed) is paramount. Failing to do so risks:

1.Inconveniencing genuine customers (false alarms).

2.Allowing fraudulent transactions to slip through (missed fraud).

This precision-reliability trade-off makes RF and DT preferable over other algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, Logistic Regression), which may yield higher accuracy but poorer fraud-specific performance.

Why Random Forest for Unbalanced Data?
The dataset is extremely imbalanced (99.87% legit vs. 0.13% fraud). RF’s ensemble approach—building multiple decision trees—helps detect subtle fraud patterns by:

1.Aggregating votes across trees to reduce overfitting.

2.Handling non-linear relationships better than single DT or parametric models (e.g., Logistic Regression).

While slower to train, RF’s robustness justifies its use.

Key Fraud-Predicting Factors
1.Request Source Security
Is the payment link/portal encrypted (HTTPS)?
2.Organization Legitimacy
Does the recipient’s name match known entities?
3.Vendor Transaction History
Frequent micro-transactions or sudden large withdrawals?
Proactive Fraud Prevention Measures
For Companies:
1.Mandate verified apps/websites for transactions.

2.Enforce VPNs + multi-factor authentication (MFA).

3.Monitor vendor histories for anomalies.

For Customers:
1.Verify bank e-statements regularly.

2.Log all transactions and report discrepancies immediately.

3.Ignore unsolicited calls/emails—banks never ask for credentials via SMS.

Measuring Prevention Effectiveness
1.Track Fraud Metrics
a.Reduction in fraud cases (false negatives). b.Fewer customer complaints about false flags (false positives).

2.Customer Awareness
a.Surveys on whether users check account activity or recognize phishing attempts.

3.System Logs
a.Analyze login attempts and transaction failures for suspicious patterns.

Final Takeaway
Fraud detection demands precision over raw accuracy. Random Forest’s ability to handle imbalance and complex rules makes it ideal. Meanwhile, user vigilance + secure infrastructure are equally vital to minimize risks. Continuous monitoring ensures adopted measures remain effective.
